{"message": "Prompt expandido:\n\nIn the depths of the cyber jungle, a beacon of light pierced through the digital underbrush. A neon tiger, its fur a vibrant electric blue and yellow, prowled through the virtual terrain with an air of confidence. Its eyes glowed like tiny stars, casting an otherworldly light on the darkened landscape.\n\nThe tiger's ears perked up, tuning into the whispers of the cyberwild. It homed in on the faint hum of a particularly juicy data packet, its tail twitching with excitement. With a burst of speed, the neon tiger pounced, its paws barely touching the ground as it chased down its quarry.\n\nThrough the dense thicket of code and circuitry, the tiger expertly navigated, dodging virtual trees and leaping over digital streams. Its claws extended, retracting, and extending again, allowing it to grasp and manipulate the slippery packets with ease.\n\nAs it stalked its prey, the cyber jungle itself began to adapt to the tiger's presence. The air was filled with a symphony of binary chirps and glitchy beeps, like a digital chorus celebrating the hunt. Virtual predators \u2013 wispy tendrils of malware and mischievous code \u2013 darted out to intercept the tiger, only to be batted aside by its glowing paws.\n\nThe neon tiger's prey, a tantalizing package of encrypted data, grew closer with each passing moment. Its tail thrumming like a bass guitar, the tiger closed in for the kill. With a swift swipe of its paw, it seized the packet and devoured it in one satisfying gulp.\n\nAs the hunt concluded, the cyber jungle fell silent, the digital creatures watching as the neon tiger sat back on its haunches, contentedly licking its paws. The stars in its eyes dimmed slightly, replaced by a warm glow of satisfaction. For in this strange, virtual world, the neon tiger was the apex predator \u2013 the king of the cyber jungle.\n\nAnd so, with its belly full and its whiskers twitching, the tiger vanished into the digital underbrush, ready to stalk its next meal in the endless expanse of code and circuitry. The cyber jungle whispered secrets in its ear, awaiting the day when it would return, paws at the ready, to prowl once more through its electronic domain."}
