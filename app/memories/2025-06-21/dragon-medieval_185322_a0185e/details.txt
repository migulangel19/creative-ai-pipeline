ORIGINAL PROMPT:
What an exciting prompt! Here's my attempt to elevate it:

"A majestic, ancient dragon with scales that shimmer like polished obsidian and fiery crimson accents, perched atop a majestic medieval castle's highest tower at dusk. The dragon's wings, spread wide in regal repose, cast long shadows across the castle walls, while its piercing emerald eyes seem to hold the very secrets of the ancient stones it guards. The setting sun casts a warm golden glow upon the scene, highlighting the intricate stonework and Gothic arches of the castle's battlements.

As the dragon's fiery breath illuminates the surrounding moat, ripples of shimmering water reflect the castle's towers and the dragon's own serpentine form, creating an ethereal, dreamlike atmosphere. The air is heavy with the scent of old parchment and forgotten knowledge, as ancient tomes and dusty scrolls spill from crumbling shelves within the castle's musty halls.

The overall style is a blend of photorealistic detail and atmospheric fantasy, with soft focus on the dragon's scales and subtle texture to the stone walls, evoking a sense of history and mystique. The composition is cinematic, framing the dragon against the backdrop of the castle, with deep shadows and warm highlights creating depth and dimensionality. The image is rendered in high definition, with intricate details from the dragon's claws to the castle's ornate windowpanes, inviting the viewer to step into this fantastical world."
